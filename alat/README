This folder contains information about how to optimize the lattice constant
of Silicon using pw calculation in scf calculation style. It contains the
following files:

=> a0.pdf # plot of total energy vs lattice constant a0 of Silicon

=> alat.plot # Gnuplot script to render the plot

=> alat.sh   # Quantum-Espresso input file embeded in bash script to
for several scf calculation with changing lattice constants (-3% to +3%)
of experimental value of 10.26254 Bohr. You need to make this file
executable by issuing 'chmod a+x alat.sh' without quote.

=> run.slurm  # SLURM job submission script. To submit job we use the command
'sbatch run.slurm' without quote.

=> spline.plot   # Gnuplot script to for fitting cubic spline interpolation
It internally uses Levenbergâ€“Marquardt algorithm. for further imformation
please see the Wikipedia page on this
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenberg%E2%80%93Marquardt_algorithm

Congratulations! Now you are ready to submit the job on Suercomputer.
